Simple Spring Boot API to a AngularJS project

#Under constructions
Here, you will find a simple Spring Boot Project + Spring Security integrated with JWToken. The concept here is provide a REST Api to a AngularJS Project where the angular project will send a token and this token will be decrypted and verified by Spring Security. The Spring Security will check this credentials included in token and permit or not access the functions.
