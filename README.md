Simple Spring Boot API to a AngularJS project

#Under construction
Here, you will find a simple Spring Boot Project + Spring Security integrated with JWToken. The concept here is provide a REST Api to a AngularJS Project where the angular project will send a token and this token will be decrypted and verified by Spring Security. The Spring Security will check this credentials included in token and permit or not access the functions.

#You will need a smtp server
To startup this application you will need a smtp server, to simulate the smtp server i use [Fake smtp server](https://nilhcem.github.io/FakeSMTP/)
